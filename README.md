# 12SEN Movie Website Framework

This is a sample framework to get started using Python, FastAPI and SQLite to create a website for tracking movie ratings.

You will need to get a TMDb API key to query their service. You can do so here: 

Once you have the API key, change line 16 of `main.py` to reflect your key.

You will also need the following libraries installed in your Python environment. 

```bash
pip3 install fastapi uvicorn jinja2 httpx python-multipart
```

To run the site type `python3 main.py` in the project's directory using Terminal.
